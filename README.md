# Simon_Says
The Simon Says Game is a memory and reaction game that uses four colors to challenge players.
• Simon begins by flashing out one color. The player must repeat the color by clicking on the corresponding color.
• After the player successfully repeats the first color, Simon adds another color to the sequence.
The player must now replicate the sequence in order.
This game enhances memory, focus, and coordination while being fun and adaptable for all ages.
